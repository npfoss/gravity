# gravity
I linked to this repo in the original Gravity [whitepaper](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2019/project/17-Foss-Pfeiffer-Woldu-Williams.pdf).
Since then, I scrapped that rushed proof of concept and did a much better job, split among the following places:

## protocol
This is the main thing, the implementation of the system described in the paper.

https://github.com/npfoss/gravity-protocol/

## minimal UI
Minimal in terms of demoing the protocol.
Suitable for developers and testing, not actual users.
